# 🏄🏻‍♂️ Curious Coder

**`Software Developer`**

I'm a back-end developer constructing various projects from the ground up. Planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems through code. I'm also a big fan of open-source and I'm always looking for new ways to contribute to the community.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Curious Coders's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
    I started my coding journey as a naive computer science student with the passion to learn everything I could about this programming world. Initially, I was teaching myself Desktop App development to build invoice generation software for a local dairy company but that was soon overshadowed by my desire to excel in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
    After achieving my BSc in Computer Science, I began an MSc in Data Science as well as starting working part-time as a Software Developer. Since completing my MSc, I've transitioned to full-time working for the same company as a Software Developer. However, I'm still very much interested in AI/ML.
    My Software Developer role involves development largely using C#, VB and SQL. During my spare time, I work on AI/ML applications using Python and C++.
